Follow - Administrative Management System
========================================

Follow is composed of several modules:

- Follow-Doc: Document Management
- Follow-WF: Workflow
- Follow-GI: Identity Management
- Follow-GC: Knowledge Management
- Follow-SR: Services and Tickets
- Follow-tp: Transport Request

The most popular module, Siga-Doc, is able to control the processing of digital or physical documents, administrative processes or files, using digital certificate signature or simply signing with login and password. This module was developed following the requirements of e-Arq, so it has a high degree of adherence.
